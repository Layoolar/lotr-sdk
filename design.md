# Lord of the Rings TypeScript SDK Design

## Introduction
The Lord of the Rings TypeScript SDK is a software development kit that provides a convenient interface for interacting with the Lord of the Rings API's movie and quote endpoints. This design document outlines the architecture and design considerations for the SDK.

## Goals and Objectives
The main goals of the Lord of the Rings TypeScript SDK are as follows:
1. Provide a user-friendly and type-safe SDK for developers to access movie and quote data from the Lord of the Rings API.
2. Abstract the complexity of API communication and authentication, allowing developers to focus on using the data in their applications.
3. Support TypeScript features and provide comprehensive type definitions for easy integration into TypeScript projects.

## Design Considerations
The design of the Lord of the Rings TypeScript SDK takes into account the following considerations:
1. API Integration: The SDK should provide a seamless integration with the Lord of the Rings API, abstracting away the details of API communication, request/response handling, and authentication.
2. Type Safety: TypeScript typings should be provided to ensure type safety and better developer experience while using the SDK.
3. Performance: The SDK should be designed to minimize unnecessary requests and optimize data retrieval for efficient usage.
4. Extensibility: The SDK should be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing future additions or modifications to the Lord of the Rings API without significant changes to the SDK itself.
5. Error Handling: The SDK should handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages and appropriate error handling mechanisms.

## Architecture
The Lord of the Rings TypeScript SDK will have the following architectural components:

1. **Base API Client**: This component will handle the low-level communication with the Lord of the Rings API, including authentication, request/response handling, and error management.

2. **Movie Service**: The Movie Service will provide methods to retrieve movie-related information from the Lord of the Rings API, such as movie details annd movies list. It will utilize the Base API Client for making API requests.

3. **Quote Service**: The Quote Service will provide methods to fetch quotes or quotes by movies from the Lord of the Rings API. It will also utilize the Base API Client for making API requests.

4. **Mixin Service**: The Mixin Service will offer functionality related to mixing and blending the movies and quotes classes into a single class

5. **Major Index File**: The Major Index File will be the main entry point of the SDK. It will combine the Movie Service and Quote Service with the Mixin to create a unified Lord of the Rings SDK object that developers can use to access the combined functionality.

6. **Types**: The Types module will define TypeScript interfaces and types to represent the data structures returned by the Lord of the Rings API, such as Movie, and Quote.



## Usage Example
Here's an example of how the Lord of the Rings TypeScript SDK could be used:

```typescript
import { LordOfTheRingsSDK } from '@layoolar/lotr_sdk';

// Create an instance of the LordOfTheRingsSDK
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
const lotrClient = new LordOfTheRingsSDK({
  apiKey: apiKey,
});

// Fetch movie details
const movie = await lotrClient.getMovieById('tt0167260');
console.log(movie);

// Get all movies
const movies = await lotrClient.getMovies();
console.log(movies);

// Get all quotes from a movie
const movieQuotes = await lotrClient.getMovieQuotes('tt0167260');
console.log(movieQuotes);

// Get all quotes
const quotes = await lotrClient.getQuotes();
console.log(quotes);

// Fetch quote details
const quote = await lotrClient.getQuoteById('tt0167260');
console.log(quote);
```

## Paginating Results

Pagination is supported for results that return lists of movies or quotes. To paginate the results, you can use the offset and limit query parameters when calling the relevant SDK methods. To paginate, create an object with `offset` and `limit` parameters (integers) and pass it to one of the following functions:

- `getMovies()`
- `getMovieQuotes()`
- `getQuotes()`

Example:

```typescript
const options = { limit: 2, offset: 0 };
const movies = await lotrClient.getMovies(options);
```


## Dependencies

**isomorphic_unfetch**: A library for making HTTP requests.

## Dev Dependenciea
@types/jest

jest

microbundle

ts-jest

typescript


## Known Issues and Limitations

The SDK currently supports only the movie and quote endpoints of the Lord of the Rings API. Support for additional endpoints may be added in future versions.
Some advanced features, such as pagination or filtering, may not be fully implemented in the current version of the SDK.
Error handling may be limited to basic scenarios and could benefit from further improvements.
Compatibility with older versions of TypeScript or specific development environments may not be guaranteed.
Please note that the Lord of the Rings TypeScript SDK is under active development, and updates may be released to address these issues and limitations in future versions.
